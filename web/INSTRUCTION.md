Do the task for me


As a opensource documentation writer, update this folder `web`

This is the sample project from fumadocs, It will be used to deploy the documentation website for this project.

The current content of the doc is just sample content, you need to replace it with relevant documentation content for this project.

Here is the structure of the documentation you need to create:

* Introduction
  * Why this folk is created
  * Key features (read the project to get the features)
  * The disadvantages of using the original project (non-optimized, not regularly updated,...) - https://github.com/balazsbotond/urlcat
  * How this fork addresses those issues
* Getting Started
  * Installation
  * Usage
* API Reference

Each section should be in a separate mdx file and should utilize different components from fumadocs to enhance the documentation.

Ensure that the content is clear, concise, and provides value to the users of the project. Use examples, code snippets, and other relevant information to make the documentation comprehensive and user-friendly.

After updating the documentation, ensure to review and proofread the content for accuracy and clarity before finalizing it.
Then update SEO metadata for each doc page to improve search engine visibility.

Finally, test the documentation website locally to ensure all links, components, and features are functioning correctly before deploying the updated documentation.
